- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phytann, I'm a CS undergraduate and full time web3 dev!
- 👀 I’m interested in how to make web3 more available and transparent so people from non-tech backgrounds can make use of it.
- 🌱 Forever learning how to best integrate with the web3 environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various sorts of projects, don't worry about reaching out!
- 📫 You can find me on twitter.com/phytannneth or on discord as Phytann#0666.
